            <h4>"Gate Way of God", Haridwar...</h4>
            <img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/43/155643-050-E9989FB0/bathing-ghat-Har-ki-pauri-Haridwar-India-Uttarakhand.jpg" alt="haridwar" height="300">
             <p> Haridwar is one of the seven holiest cities in India, situated in Uttarakhand. It is located where the sacred river Ganga enters the Indo-Gangetic plains for the first time. Dotted with temples, ashrams and narrow lanes across the city, Haridwar is a famous Hindu temple town where millions of devotees come to take a dip in the holy Ganges. It's believed that taking a dip in the sacred Har Ki Pauri relieves one of all the sins.</p>

            <h4>Manali-Valley of the Gods:</h4>
            <img src="https://www.bharattaxi.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Manali.png" alt="manali" height="300"><br>
            <p>Manali is named after the Hindu Lawgiver Manu. The name Manali is regarded as the derivative of ‘Manu-Alaya’ which literally means ‘the abode of Manu’. Legend has it that sage Manu stepped off his ark in Manali to recreate human life after a great flood had deluged the world. The valley is often referred to as the ‘Valley of the Gods’. Old Manali village has an ancient vibe to it and it also houses an ancient temple dedicated to sage Manu.

                Manali, which is famous for the apples it exports, did not originally have any apple trees. The first apple trees were introduced by the Britishers and the first apple orchard was set up by the British near Patlikuhl. To this day, apple—along with plum and pear—remain the best source of income for the majority of inhabitants. Both Rainbow and Brown Trout was also introduced into the rivers and streams of the area by the colonisers.
                
                With the increase in disposable incomes and due to its scenic beauty, Manali tourism witnessed a surge in traffic. This was once a quiet village which was transformed into a bustling town with numerous homestays as well as the occasional boutique hotel. During the warmer summer months, cafes and restaurants can be seen doing brisk business.</p>

            <h4>World's oldest city:</h4>
            <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.Lly1L95ffYItozW7-e3wngHaD4?rs=1&pid=ImgDetMain" alt="kaashi" height="300">
            <p>According to Hindu mythology, Varanasi was founded by Shiva,[37] one of three principal deities along with Brahma and Vishnu. During a conflict between Brahma and Shiva, one of Brahma's five heads was torn off by Shiva. As was the custom, the victor carried the slain adversary's head in his hand and let it hang down from his hand as an act of ignominy, and a sign of his own bravery. A bridle was also put into the mouth. Shiva thus dishonoured Brahma's head, and kept it with him at all times. When he came to the city of Varanasi in this state, the hanging head of Brahma dropped from Shiva's hand and disappeared in the ground. Varanasi is therefore considered an extremely holy site.[38]

                The Pandavas, the protagonists of the Hindu epic Mahabharata, are said to have visited the city in search of Shiva to atone for their sins of fratricide and brahmahatya that they had committed during the Kurukshetra War.[39] It is regarded as one of seven holy cities (Sapta Puri) which can provide Moksha; Ayodhya, Mathura, Haridwar, Kashi, Kanchipuram, Avanti, and Dvārakā are the seven cities known as the givers of liberation.[40] The princesses Ambika and Ambalika of Kashi were wed to the Hastinapur ruler Vichitravirya, and they later gave birth to Pandu and Dhritarashtra. Bhima, a son of Pandu, married a Kashi princess Valandhara and their union resulted in the birth of Sarvaga, who later ruled Kashi. Dhritarasthra's eldest son Duryodhana also married a Kashi princess Bhanumati, who later bore him a son Lakshmana Kumara and a daughter Lakṣmaṇā.[41]
                
                The Cakkavatti Sīhanāda Sutta text of Buddhism puts forth an idea stating that Varanasi will one day become the fabled kingdom of Ketumati in the time of Maitreya.[42]</p>
